# Electric Imp Smart Refrigerator

Create a connected refrigerator using an Electric Imp and the Predix IoT platform.

## Overview
Skill Level: Beginner

Below are detailed steps on how to connect an Electric Imp with environmental sensors to the Predix Platform in order to visualize and monitor your refrigerator in real time.

## Ingredients - what you need

### General
  - Your WIFI *network name* and *password*
  - A smartphone (iOS or Android)
  - A computer with a web browser

### Accounts
  - An [Electric Imp developer account](https://ide.electricimp.com/login)
  - A [Predix account](https://www.predix.io/registration/)
  
### Hardware
  - An Electric Imp Explorer kit - purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N47J61L/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_bzBwybD8TBQ36)

And if you want to install the board into a fridge:

  - 3 AA Batteries
  
### Software
 - The Electric Imp BlinkUp app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/electric-imp/id547133856) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electricimp.electricimp))
  - [Agent code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.agent.nut)
  - [Device code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.device.nut)
  - [Predix web application](./PredixWebApp/electric_imp_smart_fridge) files
  - [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli)
  - [CF Predix](https://github.com/PredixDev/cf-predix)

## Step-by-step

### Step 1 - What is demonstrated in this example?
Use an Electric Imp to collect temperature, humidity and light sensor data.  Analyze the sensor data to determine if your refrigerator compressor is working properly and to track if your refrigerator door has been left open.  Upload data to the Predix IoT platform to monitor and visualize your refrigerator in real time.

### Step 2 - Configure Predix account and web application

#### Predix account configuration

Open [Predix IoT](https://www.predix.io/) page in your web browser, click **SIGN IN** and login into your Predix account.

configuring.

#### Install Predix web application

The following steps are provided in detail for Mac OSX, you can use similar instructions from
the links below for the different operating systems. 

**Install [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) client**:

* if [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager isn't installed on your Mac, install it as described in the [**Install Homebrew** section](https://brew.sh/)

* in a terminal window run the command 

    `brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli`

![CF install](http://i.imgur.com/zYn2ynh.png)

If your Internet connection requires a proxy server, configure your proxy settings as described in  
[Predix Developing through a network proxy](https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials/tutorial-details.html?tutorial_id=1565).

**Install [CF Predix](https://github.com/PredixDev/cf-predix)**, a plugin for the Cloud Foundry CLI: in a terminal window run the command 

`cf install-plugin https://github.com/PredixDev/cf-predix/releases/download/1.0.0/predix_osx`

![CF Predix install](http://i.imgur.com/3aqwjYL.png)

**Log into the Predix Cloud**: in a terminal window run the command 

`cf predix`

Choose one of the regional Point Of Presence (PoP) locations that your account is set up for. This information can be found in 
your registration welcome Predix email. Enter the Email and Password of your Predix account.

![CF Predix login](http://i.imgur.com/5HgcTSl.png)

**Download** [Electric Imp's Predix web application](./PredixWebApp/electric_imp_smart_fridge) files. 

Open [web application manifest.yml](./PredixWebApp/electric_imp_smart_fridge/manifest.yml) file in a text editor.

Modify **services** and **env** section with the values obtained during the Predix account configuration steps: 

* specify **UAA Service instance name**, **Asset Service instance name**, **Time Series Service instance name** in services section
* **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in env section. 

Choose a name for your application, and modify **name** value in **applications** section.

### Step 3 - Connect your Electric Imp to the Internet

#### Set Up Hardware

1. Plug the Imp001 into the Explorer Kit Board
3. Power up your Imp with the AA batteries.

![Explorer Kit](http://i.imgur.com/6JssX74.png)

When the imp is first powered on it will blink amber/red.

#### Electric Imp BlinkUp

Use the Electric Imp mobile app to BlinkUp your device

1. In the app log into your Electric Imp developer account
2. Enter your WIFI credentials
3. Follow the instructions in the app to BlinkUp your device

When BlinkUp is successful the imp will blink green and the app will show you the device's unique ID.

For more information on BlinkUp visit the Electric Imp [Dev Center](https://electricimp.com/docs/gettingstarted/blinkup/).

### Step 4 - Connect your Electric Imp to Predix IoT

In your web browser log into the [Electric Imp IDE](https://ide.electricimp.com/login) using your Electric Imp developer account.

Click the **+** button to create a new model

![Empty IDE](http://i.imgur.com/Ui7w8eG.png)

In the pop-up enter the following information:

1. A name for your code model (ie Smart Refrigerator)
2. Select the checkbox next to your device ID, this assigns your device to this code model
3. Click **Create Model** button

Copy and paste [Predix Smart Refrigerator agent code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.agent.nut) and [Predix Smart Refrigerator device code](./SmartRefrigerator_Predix.device.nut)
into the agent and device coding windows.

![IDE code windows](http://i.imgur.com/yiCmQZu.png)

Scroll to the bottom of the agent code to find *Predix account constants* variables. Enter your [**UAA URL**](#uaa-url), [**Client ID**](#client-id), [**Client secret**](#client-secret), [**Asset URL**](#asset-url), [**Asset Zone ID**](#asset-zone-id), and [**Time Series Zone ID**](#time-series-zone-id) from **Step 2** into the corresponding variables.

For the **TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL** copy the [**WEB_APPLICATION_URL**](#web-application-url) value prefixed by "https://" and postfixed by "/ingest_data". 

It should look like 

`const TIME_SERIES_INGEST_URL = "https://electricimp-smart-fridge.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io/ingest_data";`

Click **Build and Run** to save and launch the code

![IDE with code](http://i.imgur.com/lnoCtKR.png)

Remember your **device ID** specified in the bottom left corner. It can be useful on the next step.

### Step 5 - Refrigerator data visualization

Open your [**Web Application URL**](#web-application-url) prefixed by "https://" in your web browser. 

Select your device ID from drop down list and click **Sensors Data**.

On the device page you can see the current temerature and humidity values, door status and alerts over the past hour.

### Step 7 - Optional Improvements

Your refrigerator is now connected to the internet. As you begin to gather data for your refrigerator you should adjust the static variables in your device SmartFridgeApp class to further customize your integration.

* Adjust the temperature, humidity, and lighting thresholds to optimize for your frigde
* Adjust the reading and reporting times to optimize power usage
